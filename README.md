# Match-Number-game
In this game we have 10 turns.
we choose a number between 1 to 10 and if the number is same as the number on the screen then you get 50 points else no points.
If your score is higher than the highscore then it will be saved in the highscore.
and if you are unable to cross your own highscore then you can clear the highscore too.
